    1. What are the benefits of using event delegation over attaching event listeners to individual elements?
        Event delegation means that the event is attached to a parent element instead of the child element. 
        The benefit is that you don't have to add event listeners to every child element. 
        This takes up less memory and improves performance.

    2. Explain the concept of event bubbling and how it relates to event delegation.
        Event bubbling means that when an event occurs on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, 
        then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors. 
        Event bubbling is the foundation of event delegation.

    3. How can you implement event delegation in JavaScript? Provide an example code snippet.
        You can implement event delegation in JavaScript by attaching an event listener to a parent element. 
        The event listener will then listen for events that happen on its children. 
  
        An example code snippet is:
        
        const page = document.getElementById("page");

        page.onclick = function (){
            switch (event.target.id) {
                case "wired":
                location.href = "https://www.wired.com/";
                break;
                case "pcmag":
                location.href = "https://uk.pcmag.com/";
                break;
                case "computerworld":
                location.href = "https://www.computerworld.com/";
                break;
            }
            };
        }

        NB - html would include a body with the id "page", and 3 buttons with ids of wired, pcmag and computerworld.
