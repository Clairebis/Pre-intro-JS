     1. Reserved words are words that have special meaning in a programming language, e.g. if, else, for, math, etc. 
     2. Dot notation is a way of writing an object and assigning it properties or methods [object to access][dot][property or method] 
     e.g. document.getElementById();
     3. 3 common built in objects are;
        i. Date - tell date and time
        ii. Math - perfom mathematical functions
        iii. Array - create a list - a collection of items under a single variable.
    4. JS percives elements on a webpage as objects. E.g. a <div> is an object.

    //1.
    //Declare a variable called "text" and assign it a string value.
    const text = "My text";
    //Use the "length" property of the String object to display the length of the string.
    console.log(text.length);

    //2.
    //Declare a variable called "num" and assign it a number value.
    const num = 3;
    //Use the "toFixed()" method of the Number object to display the number with exactly 2 decimal places.
    console.log(num.toFixed(2));

    //3.
    //Declare an array called "fruits" and initialize it with the following fruits: "apple", "banana", "orange".
    const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
    console.log(fruits);

    // Use push() to add a new fruit to the end of the array
    fruits.push("pear");
    console.log(fruits);

    // Use pop() to remove the last fruit from the array
    fruits.pop();
    console.log(fruits);

    // Use join() to convert the array into a string with comma-separated elements
    const fruitsString = fruits.join(", ");
    console.log(fruitsString);

    //4.
    //Use the "random()" method of the Math object to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
    const randomNum = Math.random();
    console.log(randomNum);

    //Use the "floor()" method of the Math object along with the "random()" method to generate a random whole number between 50 and 100 (both included).
    const randomNum2 = Math.floor(
      Math.random() * (101 - 50) /*range of 51*/ + 50,
    );
    console.log(randomNum2);

    /*(101 - 50) gives you a range of 51. This is because you want to generate numbers between 50 (inclusive) and 100 (inclusive), so you need a range of 51 values (100 - 50 + 1).

Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Multiplying the result of Math.random() by 51 (the range) scales the random number to the range [0, 51).

Adding 50 to the scaled random number shifts the range to [50, 101).

Finally, Math.floor() is used to round down the number to the nearest whole integer, giving you a random integer between 50 and 100 (inclusive).

So, the randomNum variable will contain a random whole number between 50 and 100 (both included).*/

    //5.
    //Declare a variable called "today" and assign it a new Date object.
    const today = new Date();
    console.log(today);

    //Use the various methods of the Date object to display the current day, month, year, and time.
    const currentDay = today.getDate();
    console.log(currentDay);

    const currentMonth = today.getMonth();
    console.log(currentMonth + 1); //months start at 0, so adding one so they start from 1 for January

    const currentYear = today.getFullYear();
    console.log(currentYear);

    const currentTime = today.toLocaleTimeString();
    console.log(currentTime);
