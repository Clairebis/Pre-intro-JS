    KNOWLEDGE
    1. What are the main features and benefits of the MVP presentation pattern?
    Seperation of Concerns - concerns of the app separated into 3 distinct components: Model, View, Presenter.
    Testability - each component can be tested separately. It becomes easier to write unit tests for each component in isolation.
    They improve maintainablilty and scalability of the application. The code is easier to understand and maintain.
    Flexibility in UI design - the view can be changed without affecting the model and presenter (underlying logic). 
    They help avoid duplication of code.
    Each component is easier to modify, extend and reuse e.g. presenters can by reused across different Views, making if efficient when building similar inferfaces with varying appearances.
    
    2. Explain the role of each component (Model, View, and Presenter) in achieving these benefits.
    Model: 
        It is responsible for the data and business logic of the application. It is the data layer of the application. 
        It contains the information to be presented to the user.
        It obtains data from databases and other services using APIs, and passes it to the presenter.

    View: 
        It is responsible for the presentation of the data to the user. It is the presentation layer of the application.
        It contains the UI elements of the application and handles the user's interactions with the application / UI.
        It receives data from the presenter and displays it to the user. In web apps it's usually the HTML markup.
        It sends user's interactions to the presenter.
        It interacts with the DOM to display information and capture user input.

    Presenter:
        Controls the flow of information between the View and Model components.
        It is responsible for the presentation logic of the application. 
        It receives data from the model and processes it.
        It receives user's interactions from the view and processes them - i.e. it responds to events triggered by the user. 
        It updates the Model and View accordingly..
        It sends data to the View to be displayed to the user.
        It sends user's interactions to the Model to be processed.
        It is the intermediary / middleman between the Model and the View.
        It is the only component that knows about the other two components.
