        KNOWLEDGE
1. How will you describe object association relation?
Associated objects are looseley connected with each other and exist independently of each other. 
The objects know about each other, and can be connected.
E.g. students & supervisors.

2. How will you describe object aggregation relation?
One type of object (the whole) is made up of the other types of object (the parts), but the objects exist independently of each other.
One object (the whole) has a major role / ownership of the other. If one is removed, the other still exists.
E.g. students and courses.

3. How will you describe object composition relation?
A stronger form of aggregation.
One type of object (the whole) is made up of the other types of object (the parts), but the parts depend on the whole.
One object (the whole) has a major role / ownership of the other. If the whole object is deleted, the parts are also deleted.
E.g. a person and their address

4. What is the difference between object association, aggregation and composition relations?
Association can model interactions between objects from different classes. There's no ownership implied by association. 
The relationship between the objects is often temporary.
Aggregation is a "has a" relationship, where one object contains or has other objects. One plays a major role and has ownership. 
The objects exist independently of each other. The parts can be shared among mulitple wholes.
E.g. a university object aggregates different department objects. The departments can exist outside of the universitey and can be shared among multiple universities.
Composition is similar to aggregation, but the relationship is stronger and dependent. Parts are typically created and destroyed along with the whole.
E.g. a car composed of an engine, wheels, and chassis objects. If the car is destroyed, the component parts are also destroyed.
