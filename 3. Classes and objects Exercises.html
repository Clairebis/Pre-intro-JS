1. How will you describe a JavaScript class?
A class is a template for creating objects. It can be described as a midwife birthing objects. 
It defines the structure (attributes / properties) and behaviour (methods) its objects will have.

2. How will you describe a JavaScript object?
An obect is a data structure that stores and organises data in key-value pairs. It is an instance of a class.

3. What is the difference between a class and an object?
A class is a template that can be reused to create multiple objects. ´
An object is a structure that contains data about a particular thing. The hold data and perfom actions (methods) defined by their class.
Objects have unique values for their properties while still adhering to the structure defined by the class.
Classes allow you to create consistent objects and allow code to be more organised.

4. What is the purpose of a class constructor?
A class constructor sets up how the class will be structured / oragnised. It needs to be set up when creating a new class.¨
a. Initialization - It sets up the initial state of the object by assigning vaules to its properties.
b. Automatic Invocation - When you make a new object using the "new" keyword, the constructor is automatically invoked.
c. Parameters - Constructors accepts parameters that are used to pass initial values to the object's properties. 
They're typically passed when creating a new object using the "new" keyword.

5. How will you describe a Singleton?
A Singleton is basically an object that's a single entity.. It can be used when users are interacting with our product, eg. typing in forms, selecting items, etc.
It often only exists temporarily and disappears when it's processed. 
It can be used when temporary processing of information is needed.
